Here is our project folder for our group composed of:
  > Jonathan Rozanes
  > Guillaume Catto
  > Thomas Fossati
  > Edouard Piette

The folder contains all the necessary files for you to test our program(s):
  > The sws_qX.{cpp,h} files, for each question
  > inet_socket.{cpp,h} files, from our classes, useful for some programs
  > utility.{cpp,h} files, containing some functions used for questions {5..7}
  > The makefile, where you can:
    >> build all files (make all)
    >> build a given file (make sws_qX)
    >> clean the *.o files (make clean)
    >> clean the *.o files and the built programs (make dist-clean)
  > The report (report.pdf), written in French, for question 1

PS: sws_q7.cpp has been entirely refactored, using the functions in inet_socket.cpp
  and utility.cpp
